# File-based Sorter  
---

This program aims to provide a way to sort file directories based on file types. The sorting pattern will be based off of Documents, Pictures, Videos, Music, Archives, and Miscellaneous files.  

---

## Use case  

This program should only be used for simple sorting processes. I strongly advise the use of this program for more serious tasks as the program may not be suited for such uses.  

---

## How to use

After running main.py, you will be prompted to enter the file directory you want to sort. Enter the directory and watch as the program sort everything out. That's about it.

## Sorting pattern

Below is the sorting pattern used in making the program work.  
Documents - ...  
Pictures - ...  
Videos - ...  
Music - ...  
Archives - ...  
Miscellaneous - everything else that the pattern wasn't able to recognize.
